Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves 
around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. 
There are four main pillars of OOP:

Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) 
that operate on the data into a single unit or class.This protects the data from outside interference 
and misuse.

Abstraction: Abstraction refers to hiding the complex implementation details and 
showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows the programmer to focus on what the 
object does rather than how it does it.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another 
class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of hierarchical 
relationships between classes.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common 
superclass. It allows methods to be overridden in subclasses, providing different implementations
 while still maintaining a consistent interface.
